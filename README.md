## Intro

NPM Workspaces is a powerful way to manage a suite of javascript / typescript applications in a monorepo.

## Requirements

NPM Workspaces was introduced with version 7, so if you are using an earlier version anywhere in the build flow, the build will fail.

## Getting Started

```
npm run start -w @rnw/todo
```
