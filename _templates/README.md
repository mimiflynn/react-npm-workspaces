## Why generate code?

[An exellent case study with Redux](https://www.hygen.io/docs/redux/)
### Code consistency

Consistent code patterns create predictable applications. When moving from working on one app to the next, a consistent code organization and data flow allows a developer to stay productive without having to reframe the application paradigm in their minds.

### Efficiency

Building a new app or package? Instead of copying and pasting an existing app and trying to figure out what should stay and what should go after a large scale search and replace, you can just generate a seed app or package with the appropriate parameters and start writing useful code.
